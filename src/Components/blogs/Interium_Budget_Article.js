            <h2>What is a Budget?</h2>
            <p>
              The Union Budget for a year is referred to as the Annual financial
              statement under Article 112 of the Indian Constitution It is an
              estimation of revenue and expenditure of the central government
              over a specified period of tune which is usually one year. (On

            </p>

            <h2>Interim V/S Union,What's the difference?</h2>
            <p>
              Union Budget as mentioned in the constitution is the Estimation of
              bills and revenues for an upcoming year.An interim budget differs
              from a union budget in that it serves as a temporary financial
              plan for the government when elections are approaching. This
              budget seeks parliamentary approval for the government to cover
              expenses for the remaining months in its term. Unlike a Union
              budget, which outlines the entire year, an interim budget focuses
              on the transition period until the new government takes charge.
            </p>
            <h2>Process of a Budget</h2>
            <p>
              The budget division of the Department of economic affairs (DEA) in
              the finance ministry is the nodal body responsible for producing
              the budget.

            <h2>Fiscal Deficit </h2>
            <p>
              When the government spends more than its total income, such a
              situation is called a fiscal deficit. It is calculated by
              subtracting the total income from the total expenditure and is
              either expressed in absolute terms or as a percentage of the GDP
              (Gross Domestic Product)
              <br />
              Fiscal deficit = Total Expenditure by Government - Total Income
              <br />
              Where, Total Income of the government is calculated by including
              taxes, non-debt capital receipts and other forms of revenue except
              borrowings.
              <br />
              <strong>
                India's interim budget for 2024 presented some key points
                regarding the fiscal deficit:
              </strong>
            </p>

            <h3>Revised Estimate for 2023-24:</h3>
            <p>
              The revised estimate for the fiscal deficit in the current
              financial year (2023-24) is 5.8% of GDP, slightly lower than the
              budgeted target of 5.9%. This indicates the government managed to
              keep spending in check.
            </p>
            <h3>Target for 2024-25:</h3>
            <p>
              The budgeted fiscal deficit for the next financial year (2024-25)
              is set at 5.1% of GDP. This is lower than market expectations of
              around 5.3-5.4%, surprising many analysts.
            </p>
            <h2>Key factors contributing to the lower deficit:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Increased tax collection: Improved tax collection, including
                expanded luxury taxes, helped generate more revenue for the
                government.
              </li>
              <li>
                Controlled subsidies: Reducing subsidies, especially on
                non-essential items, also helped manage spending.
              </li>
              <li>
                Prioritizing capital expenditure: Despite the lower deficit
                target, the government increased the capital expenditure outlay
                by 11.1% to focus on infrastructure development.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Implications:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                This focus on fiscal consolidation indicates the government's
                commitment to responsible spending even in an election year.
              </li>
              <li>
                The lower deficit target could potentially improve India's
                credit rating and attract foreign investments.
              </li>
              <li>
                However, some experts caution that achieving this target might
                require further expenditure cuts, which could impact certain
                sectors.
              </li>

            <h2>Commitment to net zero by 2070:</h2>
            <p>
              India's interim budget for 2024-25, presented on February 1st,
              2024, placed a significant emphasis on achieving net-zero
              emissions by 2070. Here are some key takeaways:

                    install solar panels on the rooftops of 1 crore (10 million)
                    households, potentially generating 25 GW of clean energy and
                    enabling free electricity to those households.
                  </li>
                  <li>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The budget continued existing schemes like UJALA (LED bulb
                    distribution) and Street Light National Programme, promoting
                    energy efficiency.
                  </li>
                  <li>

                    <strong>Reactions and Analysis:</strong>
                  </p>
                  <li>
                    Experts viewed the budget as a positive step towards
                    achieving net-zero, but also highlighted the need for
                    concrete implementation plans and long-term financing
                    strategies.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Concerns were raised about the sufficiency of allocated

            <h3>Overall:</h3>
            <p>
              While the interim budget offered a clear direction towards a
              greener future, the effectiveness of these initiatives in
              achieving net-zero emissions will depend on their efficient
              implementation, continued financial support, and broader economic
              and social transformations.
              <br />
              It's important to note that this is an interim budget, and a full
              budget will be presented later in the year, which may provide
              further details and clarifications on these initiatives.{" "}

            <h4>Concerns:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Cuts in spending on health and education.</li>
              <li>No major announcements on job creation.</li>
              <li>Impact of global economic slowdown on fiscal targets.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Overall: </h4>
            <p>
              The budget prioritizes fiscal consolidation and infrastructure
              development, with some focus on specific groups. However, it lacks
              major populist measures and faces challenges from global economic
              uncertainties and spending cuts in key sectors.
