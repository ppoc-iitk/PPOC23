                        The Uttar Pradesh State Law Commission has put out the draft of THE UTTAR PRADESH
                        POPULATION(CONTROL, STABILISATION AND WELFARE) BILL, 2021 for public comments and
                        recommendations a couple of days before the World Population Day, being celebrated today. The
                        state is second in line to introduce such a bill on population control after Assam did so in
                        June 2021. Such a Bill (Population Regulation Bill, 2019) was even proposed in Rajya Sabha in
                        July 20219 by Rakesh Sinha.

                        In the country with the second-largest population, the demands of such population control
                        measures have been up for discussion for several decades. The government initiated several
                        family planning schemes, which have had varied consequences
                    </p>
                    <h2>Understanding the need for Population Control:</h2>
                    <p>
                        From the 1970s to 2010s, the 10-year growth rate has gradually come down to 16.8% from as high
                        as 25.9%.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        However, the share of India in the global population has been strictly increasing. We currently
                        account for 17.8% of global population but only 2.4% of global surface and 4% of water resources
                        (2011 data). According to estimates by UN World Population Prospects 2019, our population will
                        have a continuous positive growth rate till 2060, stagnating our population at 1.65 billion
                        until it starts decreasing.
                    </p>

                        <img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1Is56gFP8P4/YOqcfk8dOLI/AAAAAAAAAKw/hjBsYhvZ0B4aXVih1yukTm6efme7Z9b7ACLcBGAsYHQ/w551-h309/Screenshot%2B%2528162%2529.png"

                    <p>
                        The general consensus is that our current problems of poverty, unemployment, low per capita
                        income and related issues are largely because of overpopulation. Often our large population is
                        termed as a large and active workforce. But that is only when there is a significant investment
                        in pre-requirements like education, healthcare and nutrition. With such a large population, and
                        a significant proportion of it ageing under 50, the pressure to meet their basic requirements of
                        quality education, healthcare, nutrition and employment in the future will be huge when even the
                        existing system is not working well in the current times.

                        This crisis will only deepen with the increasing population because of the finiteness of our
                        resources. The Census of India states that the percentage of the urban population has also been
                        increasing and hence the pressure will be more on the urban economy.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Lessons from History</h2>
                    <p>
                        The initial measures of population control mainly were calling public for family planning and
                        promotion to contraceptives till the 1960s. The ineffectiveness of these measures forced the
                        government to frame more target-oriented policies and use coercive methods to implement
                        population control. During the 1970s, to bring down the annual growth rate to 2.5%,
                        sterilisation camps were thought of as an effective solution for population control and family
                        planning. The use of force to promote this campaign led to widespread fear among the masses and
                        ultimately to the failure of the program as the growth rate increased significantly
                    </p>
                    <p style={{"text-align": "center"}}>
                        <img src="https://i1.wp.com/feminisminindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/82155424_steranbb175t-still1.jpg?w=640&ssl=1"
                            alt="hello" />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Post-1980s, the government adopted voluntary family planning schemes. The effectiveness of
                        voluntary measures without significant incentives is questionable since the growth remained
                        significantly higher than in other countries. The overall reduction in population growth rate is
                        more likely caused because of increased literacy and socio-economic development.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Brief Outline of UP Population Bill, 2021</h2>
                    <p>
                        Unlike its Chinese counterpart, the Bill drives to achieve its aim by incentivising having less
                        than three children rather than criminalising its violation. The following benefits are given to
                        public servants if they voluntarily undergo sterilisation upon themselves or their spouse:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Two additional increments during entire services.</li>
                        <li>

                            Subsidy and loans for housing purchase and construction.
                        </li>
                        <li>

                            Maternity/paternity leave for 12 months with full salary.
                        </li>
                        <li>

                            Free healthcare benefits and insurance coverage of the child till the age of 20.
                        </li>
                        <li>

                            Preference to admission to educational institutes and government jobs.
                        </li>
                        <li>

                            Scholarship to the girl child
                        </li>


                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Families living below the poverty line will get added monetary benefits in case of having a
                        single child. These incentives (barring a few) are extended to the general public (non-public
                        sector) if they undergo voluntary sterilisation. It would be interesting to see how the private
                        sector reacts to such a law and if it initiates any such measures in compliance with the above
                        Bill.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Moreover, the Bill places a few restrictions and disincentives on families violating the
                        two-child policy.
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Disallow contesting any local-body elections.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Limit ration card units up to four.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Debarring from Government-sponsored welfare schemes or subsidies

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Bar on applying and promotion in government jobs

                        </li>
                    </ol>



                    </p>
                    <h3>Do we require a national law?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Probably not.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The TFR of most states is below 2.1. Only populated states like <b>Bihar (TFR-3.0), UP
                            (TFR-3.0),
                            Madhya Pradesh (TFR-2.7) and Rajasthan(TFR-2.7) </b>have such high numbers (Data of 2017;
                        not shown
                        in the chart as data of 2019 unavailable). The large population size of these states push the
                        national average of TFR above 2.2 .
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Prolonged TFR less than 2.1 will lead to a significantly high number of elderly people a couple
                        of decades from now. And we will be exactly where Japan and China are today. Instead, a
                        decentralised population control policy in states of higher population and TFR will prove more
                        effective in mitigating impacts of a large population without long term ill-effects
                    </p>
                    <h3>Role of Women</h3>
                    <p style={{"text-align": "center"}}>
                        <img src="https://wol.iza.org/uploads/articles/228/images/IZAWOL.228.ga.png" alt="map" />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An important consideration while chalking out a population control policy is the strengthening
                        of women in family planning. Several studies show that higher levels of education and income
                        amongst women increase the mean age of marriage and decrease the fertility rate.

                    </p>
                    <p>

                        As the National Family Health Survey-4 (2015-16) notes, women in the lowest wealth quintile have
                        an average of 1.6 more children than women in the highest wealth quintile, translating to a
                        total fertility rate of 3.2 children versus 1.5 children moving from the wealthiest to the
                        poorest. Similarly, the number of children per woman declines with a woman’s level of schooling.
                        Women with no schooling have an average of 3.1 children, compared with 1.7 children for women
                        with 12 or more years of schooling.

                    </p>
                    <p>

                        This reveals the depth of the connections between health, education and inequality, with those
                        having little access to health and education being caught in a cycle of poverty, leading to more
                        and more children, and the burden that state control on the number of children could impose on
                        the weakest. Hence to achieve a fertility rate of 2.1, designing a policy that focuses on giving
                        the control of family planning to women by directing incentives towards them can be more
                        fruitful in the long run to control the population.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This, however, is not the case with the current Bill. Incentivising the employed member of the
                        family may lessen the desired impact due to lesser female employment. The future schemes under
                        this Bill will have to include women as target beneficiaries for better results
                    </p>
                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        Implementing such law in specific states will bring us down from the projected 1.65 billion
                        population by 2060. If we can stagnate this number to 1.40-1.45 billion within next two decades,
                        we will be at a great vantage point. We need to simultaneously prepare to cater for the needs of
                        a population of 1.40-1.45 billion as this number is inevitable.
