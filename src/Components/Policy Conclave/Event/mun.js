              <br></br>
              <p>
                IITK MUN is a highlight of the Flagship event Policy Conclave
                23, Unfolded on April 15th & 16th, proving to be a resounding
                success. Enthusiastic students across disciplines converged for
                stimulating debate and diplomacy, fostering critical thinking,
                diplomatic skills , and a deeper grasp of global affairs. The
                All India Political Parties Meet(AIPPM) committee addressed the
                escalating issues of unemployment amidst a growing population.
                Drawing participants form within and beyond the college, the
                MUN’s triumph was attributed to the diligent efforts of the
                organizing committee and the lively engagement of the delegates.
